She whom I love, left me give  years ago


Memories remains, I cried with regret


She whom I love, I still cannot let go


Afterall, I still have not paid my debt.









Goodbye "ngoai", I wanted to say those words


But distance forbid, nothing was exchange


Time flew by fast, broken heart is uncured


Scrambled in my thought, I'm going insane.









The rustic hammock, alone in the house


Where are the young girl and her grandmother?


The sun scorched the roof, silence as a muse


Wander around, I miss my grandmother





Should have spend more time with her when I could


Grandma's loneliness, now I understood.
