The sun shone with a scorching radiance that would compel any passerby to indulge themselves in the luxurious shade of the many alligator-apple trees lining the sides of the gentle riverbank. Particularly hungry Sunday strollers would often pick armfuls of those delectable fruits, drawn by the light, sweet, green apple scent that wafted through the air. With satisfied smiles and homemade palm leaf baskets overflowing with fresh treasures, they would continue their paths towards home. Just across the river sat a humble food stall and a small, serious woman who owned it. Hardly anyone could resist the pungent, nutty aromas of fermented shrimp paste and zesty, citrus scents of lemongrass that emanated from Mrs. Lan’s bún bò stall. Young couples and families alike frequented her business for a warm bowl of it, no matter the time of year. Those who had never tried her bún bò could not help but have their curiosity piqued by the waves of customers that flocked to Mrs. Lan’s stall each day.\r\n            Mrs. Lan lived but just five minutes down the road from her food stall with her daughter, Hanh, and her son, Truong. Despite living so close to the business that she poured every ounce of energy into, she still rose at dawn each morning with the crowing of the rooster to carry the weighty buckets of bún bò broth down to the river. Armed with her trusty bamboo pole on her shoulders, Mrs. Lan would deliver pounds and pounds of the soup that she slaved over to her stand. Beside her always was her young daughter, Hanh, with arms full of rustic bamboo chairs for their customers to sit and enjoy their meal by the sweeping stream. Day after day, Mrs. Lan and Hanh would start their morning walk to their stall to begin a long, fruitful day of work. Serving bowl upon bowl of bún bò to their eager customers, the two of them were an unstoppable team. Every minute of their busy day was spent taking orders, washing dishes, and feeding the people of Ðồng Nai. Strangely enough, the only one never seen helping the family bún bò business was Mrs. Lan’s son, Truong.\r\n            For the past year, Hanh could not help but notice that something in her perfectly routine life was off. She had lived the same day again and again since the time that she could walk, only now did she realize that time had taken its toll on her mother. Waking up before the sun and working until dark was something that Hanh always saw as normal, she never thought she would live to see her mother so worn down and tired. Mrs. Lan’s hands ached like never before, she couldn’t carry nearly as much on her shoulders as she used to, and her mother wore a smile that just barely hid the weariness behind her eyes. Hanh knew that her mother could not keep up this life forever, but she also knew that her mother had every intention of going until her last breath and passing her life’s work onto Truong. Worried about what would become of the business once it fell into her brother’s careless hands, Hanh wanted to voice her concerns as directly as she could. So, after months of deliberation and hesitation, she finally decided to approach her mother about the future of the business.\r\n            “Mom, I have to ask you a question,” Hanh said.\r\n            Her mother brushed her off with nothing more than a swat of her hand. “Not now, Hanh! Don’t you see how busy I am?” She furrowed her brow as her calloused hands nimbly ladled the steaming broth into bowls.\r\n            Hanh frowned, she suddenly spurted out what had been weighing on her mind, “What does Truong have that I don’t? He doesn’t even bother to help us; can’t you see the way he wastes his life?”\r\n            Her daughter’s assertive question caught Mrs. Lan off guard, and she began to feel the prickles of annoyance swell into anger. “Not now.” she repeated firmly.\r\n            After hiding her true thoughts for so long, there was no way Hanh could let the issue go. Now that she had finally pulled together the courage to ask something so bold of her mother, her mouth and mind were like a faucet that could not possibly turn off. “Mom!” Hanh spouted, “I’ve spent every day of my life watching you; I know how hard we struggle to get by. I mastered the secret bún bò family recipe so that I could help, and yet I am the only one who cares and he’s not here. I should not be the only one that knows this is not fair! We work too hard to bring home the money that he turns around and burns on drinking and gambling.”\r\n            “So, what if he drinks? So, what if he gambles?” Mrs. Lan snapped. “He’s the only legitimate son that this family has.”\r\n            At the sound of this, Hanh couldn’t help but laugh in disbelief, “Oh, so he’s exempts because he’s the ‘legitimate son’? Grandmother didn’t seem to care about the legitimate son or anyone else when she kicked us out of the house after father died.”\r\n            “Hanh! —” Her mother began to raise her voice but was quickly silenced by a knot in her throat. Her eyes pooled with tears as she recalled flashbacks from the day her family was cast out on the streets.\r\n            Ms. Lan always knew that Mr. and Mrs. Tran, the wealthiest landowners in the area, would never allow their son to marry her. The fact that their son fell in love with a maid such as herself brought shame to their family. When Ms. Lan announced that she was with child, the Tran family did everything in their power to keep the news from getting out. She obeyed every demand they had, but when she bore them their grandson and natural heir, Truong, a cold indifference developed. When they welcomed their daughter, their indifference simply grew. The final straw came with the death of the Tran family son, Ms. Lan’s beloved. When he passed away from a rare respiratory disease, his parents claimed that a fortune teller had warned them of her evil influence. His parents threw them out on the street in a heartbeat. With no money and no home, Ms. Lan and her children wandered far away, leaving their tragedy behind.\r\n            When she felt her tears fall to her cheeks she snapped back into reality. “…You can’t talk to me like this.”\r\n            “I have been nothing but respectful and helpful to you all my life,” Hanh said. “But you still treat me like I’m in the way! I am your daughter, not your source of shame. Just because I was born a woman, and I am not the man of the house, doesn’t mean I don’t have what it takes to run this business.”\r\n            Her mother huffed as she busied her hands with the dirty bowls left by previous customers. “I said not now, Hanh! Just stop. Enough is enough.”\r\n            “You can’t keep making excuses for him mom, especially not if you want him to take over one day. We both know he doesn’t care about it like I do!”\r\n            “I said stop!” Mrs. Lan shouted. In her frustration, a porcelain bowl slipped from her hands and shattered across the ground. Customers surrounding the stand went silent, their eyes drawn to Mrs. Lan and Hanh’s standoff. Sensing a greater argument about to unfold, some awkwardly slurped their noodles and left while others laid their money on the counter without so much as touching a single chopstick to their meal they had abandoned.\r\n            No one would have ever expected that it was the last time they could enjoy Mrs. Lan’s flavorful bowl of beef noodle soup while admiring the peaceful riverside scenery. Rumor has it that Hanh killed her mom in anger later that night and ran away. Mr. Tam, a frequent customer, who lived near Mrs. Lan insisted that he heard her cry out her daughter’s name, “Hanh”, followed by a chilling, “Don’t do it! This is all yours”. Then nothing but silence.\r\n            “No way she could have done it,” argued Mrs. Trang. “She has always been such a sweetheart.”\r\n            “She nourished a viper in her bosom. Did you not hear about their fight earlier that day?” another neighbor chimed in.\r\n            But the truth is, her son Truong had been at the end of a frayed rope for quite some time. After the loss of his father and a childhood spent trying to teach himself the ways of a family man, he fell into the vices of alcohol and gambling. These addictions controlled his life and molded him into a person that could not stand to lose any more than he already had. When he drank, his bitter demeanor turned to violent rage. Even worse, when he lost a bet, his rage was nearly uncontrollable and his thirst for money was unquenchable.\r\n            One night, particularly on edge from a night of losing bets in a cock fighting ring, an intoxicated Truong came back in a belligerent state. The neighbors did not know it was him who caused such a scene when he went inside and started to fling things all over the house in search of money.\r\n            That night, Hanh woke up from the loud crashes and thuds coming from the rest of the house. At the same time, Mrs. Lan woke up to see what could have possibly been going on. She rushed into the living room, fearing there was an intruder in their house. When he saw his mother come in, Truong lunged toward her and wrapped both hands around her neck. Shaking with drunken rage, he was squeezing her neck and screaming, “Old hag! Where is the money?”\r\n            Struggling to breathe, Mrs. Lan stuttered, “I-i don’t have any more m-money this month, we took a loss in profit! You won’t see any for a w-while.”\r\n            Truong’s face turned deep red as he gripped her neck tighter. “I don’t fucking care about your stupid bun bo stall, or whether you make a profit or not! I want money!” He grunted, “NOW.”\r\n            Although Hanh and her mother had not talked since the incident earlier, she leapt to action and tried her best to pull Truong’s hands off of her. He jerked his hand when Hanh came near, sending her flying into the cupboard. While next to it, Hanh grabbed a knife from the nearby table and threatened Truong.\r\n            “Let go of mom, or I’m going to stab you!”\r\n            Truong directed his attention away from Mrs. Lan.\r\n            “Oh, look who’s talking?”\r\n            He rushed toward his sister, grabbing for her wrist. He held on tightly and quickly twisted it. The sharp pain was too much for her and Hanh dropped the knife she had pointed at Truong. Their mother, who had dropped to the floor while struggling for air, crawled across the ground to hold Truong’s leg.\r\n            Hoarsely she begged, “Please don’t do it.” Sadly, Truong did not care. He picked up the knife from the floor and put it to Hanh’s throat.\r\n            “Sister, you are very brave today.”\r\n            Hanh spat on Truong’s face. “Your worthless pig!”\r\n            Truong held the knife tighter and moved it closer to Hanh’s throat, “Oh, shut up, you lousy woman.”\r\n            Mrs. Lan struggled, but kept hanging onto Truong’s leg and begged him, “It is all yours, everything, including the money and the business.”\r\n            Truong bent down, plunging his knife through the air and stabbed Mrs. Lan in her back several times. “If I were not the son of a lowlife like you, I would be swimming in gold. The money and the business have always been mine.”\r\n            Truong took a breath as he came closer to Mrs. Lan. He held her face, stroked her hair and said, “Rest in peace mom, you daughter will join you soon.” Truong, then, looked over at the horrified Hanh.\r\n            With a jolt of energy, Mrs. Lan screamed out, “Hanh!”\r\n            Hanh turned to face her mother who, using her last breath, mumbled, “…run”.\r\n            Hanh tried her best to run throughout the field in the complete darkness. After witnessing her mother’s tragic death, Hanh had lost her ability to talk. She was in a complete state of shock and no matter how hard she tried; no noise came out of her mouth.\r\n            Hanh was fast, but Truong was even faster. He caught up to her and pulled her long, silky hair like a cord, making her fall into the mud. She prayed to Buddha, promising that if she could escape, she would dedicate her life to helping other people.\r\n            Maybe it was pure luck, or maybe it was Buddha who helped her; but during the struggle, her brother’s feet were caught in a row of bamboo spike traps that had been laid around the outside of a field. Covered in waste and brush to prevent animals from eating the crops, Truong had not seen the spikes until it was too late. He screamed out in pain, holding the foot that had been punctured. Hanh took the opportunity to push his foot further down the spike, leaving him immobile. She proceeded to pick up the knife that Truong had dropped and stabbed him in the heart. She stood and watched until he bled to death. When sunrise came and Truong took his last breath, Hanh simply walked away.\r\n            From that night on, no one knew where Hanh went, she simply disappeared.\r\n            Far across the globe, in the land of opportunity, stands a humble Vietnamese restaurant, “Lemongrass”. It was only three in the morning when a woman with smooth, shoulder-length hair slowly rose from her bed. She tiptoes her way into the bathroom, afraid that she might wake up the man lying next to her. Looking in the mirror, she finds several strands of grey hair, stopping only to notice that at the outer edges of her eyes, there were wrinkles. She gets dressed, remembering to kiss her child in the room across from her own before leaving the house for the day.\r\n            This bustling, new restaurant is in one of the strip malls ten minutes down the road from her home. She carries bags and bags of fresh ingredients; garlic, shallots, banana flowers, citrus, and greens inside that had just been bought from the nearby store. Along with these groceries, she also carries in a single bouquet of yellow daisies.\r\n            Grabbing a large aluminum pot from the rack, she continues to brew the fragrant broth of lemongrass stalks, pig bones, beef shank and oxtail that she had carefully prepared the night before. Next to this boiling pot, a wok filled with vibrant, red annatto oil and sliced garlic and shallots was creating a flavorful stir fry. She waited until she could smell the zingy aroma from the sizzling pan to turn off the stove and set it to the side. Afterwards, she gets out a bag of banana flowers to slice above a bowl of cold water and squeezed lime. She tears bunches of water spinach over another bowl of water while setting a pot of vermicelli noodles to boil and drain. After five long hours, she has finally done prepping her bun bo. The finishing touch on her dish is a generous seasoning of salt, sugar, and spoonful of the earthy fermented shrimp paste. Her kitchen was flooded with the complex scents of spicy chilis, nutty broth, and bright citrus garnish.\r\n            Every day, before opening her restaurant doors to the people, she brings a plate full of apples and a bundle of incense sticks as an offering to the god of wealth to wish for plenty of customers. Today, however, is more special than normal. After finishing her routine offering, she brings her bouquet of yellow daisies and neatly arranges it in a porcelain vase decorated with blue patterns. Then, she carries a ceramic bowl of bun bo and neatly lays it on the altar next to the vase of flowers. She kneels and with three incense sticks in her hand, she prays, “Today marks the twentieth year since you passed away, I still miss you every day.” She looks around and continues on, “I opened my very own restaurant last week and I named it ‘Lemongrass’, after the key bun bo ingredient that you grew in the backyard. I have been very successful with your recipe. I wish you were here to see for yourself how successful the daughter you despised so much has become.”\r\n            Mrs. Lan’s picture frame was neatly placed in the middle of the altar, in the picture she was smiling.\r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n            \r\n              Lemongrass\r\n            \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                \r\n                                  \r\n              \r\n            \r\n            \r\n              It’s the beginning of another average afternoon in the small village of Ðồng Nai, Vietnam.

While next to it, Hanh grabbed a knife from the nearby table and threatened Truong.\r\n              “Let go of mom, or I’m going to stab you!”\r\n              Truong directed his attention away from Mrs. Lan.\r\n              “Oh, look who’s talking?”\r\n              He rushed toward his sister, grabbing for her wrist. He held on tightly and quickly twisted it. The sharp pain was too much for her and Hanh dropped the knife she had pointed at Truong. Their mother, who had dropped to the floor while struggling for air, crawled across the ground to hold Truong’s leg.\r\n              Hoarsely she begged, “Please don’t do it.” Sadly, Truong did not care. He picked up the knife from the floor and put it to Hanh’s throat.\r\n              “Sister, you are very brave today.”\r\n              Hanh spat on Truong’s face. “Your worthless pig!”\r\n              Truong held the knife tighter and moved it closer to Hanh’s throat, “Oh, shut up, you lousy woman.”\r\n              Mrs. Lan struggled, but kept hanging onto Truong’s leg and begged him, “It is all yours, everything, including the money and the business.”\r\n              Truong bent down, plunging his knife through the air and stabbed Mrs. Lan in her back several times. “If I were not the son of a lowlife like you, I would be swimming in gold. The money and the business have always been mine.”\r\n              Truong took a breath as he came closer to Mrs. Lan. He held her face, stroked her hair and said, “Rest in peace mom, you daughter will join you soon.” Truong, then, looked over at the horrified Hanh.\r\n              With a jolt of energy, Mrs. Lan screamed out, “Hanh!”\r\n              Hanh turned to face her mother who, using her last breath, mumbled, “…run”.\r\n              Hanh tried her best to run throughout the field in the complete darkness. After witnessing her mother’s tragic death, Hanh had lost her ability to talk. She was in a complete state of shock and no matter how hard she tried; no noise came out of her mouth.\r\n              Hanh was fast, but Truong was even faster. He caught up to her and pulled her long, silky hair like a cord, making her fall into the mud. She prayed to Buddha, promising that if she could escape, she would dedicate her life to helping other people.\r\n              Maybe it was pure luck, or maybe it was Buddha who helped her; but during the struggle, her brother’s feet were caught in a row of bamboo spike traps that had been laid around the outside of a field. Covered in waste and brush to prevent animals from eating the crops, Truong had not seen the spikes until it was too late. He screamed out in pain, holding the foot that had been punctured. Hanh took the opportunity to push his foot further down the spike, leaving him immobile. She proceeded to pick up the knife that Truong had dropped and stabbed him in the heart. She stood and watched until he bled to death. When sunrise came and Truong took his last breath, Hanh simply walked away.\r\n              From that night on, no one knew where Hanh went, she simply disappeared.\r\n              Far across the globe, in the land of opportunity, stands a humble Vietnamese restaurant, “Lemongrass”. It was only three in the morning when a woman with smooth, shoulder-length hair slowly rose from her bed. She tiptoes her way into the bathroom, afraid that she might wake up the man lying next to her. Looking in the mirror, she finds several strands of grey hair, stopping only to notice that at the outer edges of her eyes, there were wrinkles. She gets dressed, remembering to kiss her child in the room across from her own before leaving the house for the day.\r\n              This bustling, new restaurant is in one of the strip malls ten minutes down the road from her home. She carries bags and bags of fresh ingredients; garlic, shallots, banana flowers, citrus, and greens inside that had just been bought from the nearby store. Along with these groceries, she also carries in a single bouquet of yellow daisies.\r\n              Grabbing a large aluminum pot from the rack, she continues to brew the fragrant broth of lemongrass stalks, pig bones, beef shank and oxtail that she had carefully prepared the night before. Next to this boiling pot, a wok filled with vibrant, red annatto oil and sliced garlic and shallots was creating a flavorful stir fry. She waited until she could smell the zingy aroma from the sizzling pan to turn off the stove and set it to the side. Afterwards, she gets out a bag of banana flowers to slice above a bowl of cold water and squeezed lime. She tears bunches of water spinach over another bowl of water while setting a pot of vermicelli noodles to boil and drain. After five long hours, she has finally done prepping her bun bo. The finishing touch on her dish is a generous seasoning of salt, sugar, and spoonful of the earthy fermented shrimp paste. Her kitchen was flooded with the complex scents of spicy chilis, nutty broth, and bright citrus garnish.\r\n              Every day, before opening her restaurant doors to the people, she brings a plate full of apples and a bundle of incense sticks as an offering to the god of wealth to wish for plenty of customers. Today, however, is more special than normal. After finishing her routine offering, she brings her bouquet of yellow daisies and neatly arranges it in a porcelain vase decorated with blue patterns. Then, she carries a ceramic bowl of bun bo and neatly lays it on the altar next to the vase of flowers. She kneels and with three incense sticks in her hand, she prays, “Today marks the twentieth year since you passed away, I still miss you every day.” She looks around and continues on, “I opened my very own restaurant last week and I named it ‘Lemongrass’, after the key bun bo ingredient that you grew in the backyard. I have been very successful with your recipe. I wish you were here to see for yourself how successful the daughter you despised so much has become.”\r\n              Mrs. Lan’s picture frame was neatly placed in the middle of the altar, in the picture she was smiling.\r\n            \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    ",

PCA, Principle Component Analysis is one of the technique that is most commonly use in this particular machine learning to find a better set of data without the unnecessary components or variable to it. This exercise below will demonstrate how the PCA can recognize the important variables from the unimportant one, and reduce the data set in a way that the data will be easier to visualize as its variables are now stay true to the core of the data set. This machine learning can be important to the planning phase of an audit when the clients send too many data that are not necessary relevant to the subject at hand. Auditors could use this technique to narrow down the data set and see a clearer picture of an organization.\r\nFirst Code Chuck: Original Code with Two Components\r\nStep 1: take the 4 different variable and perform the principle component analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(caret)\r\n\r\ndat <- iris\r\n\r\ncaret.pca <- preProcess(dat[,-5], method=\"pca\",pcaComp=2)\r\n\r\ncaret.pca\r\n\r\n\r\nCreated from 150 samples and 4 variables\r\n\r\nPre-processing:\r\n  - centered (4)\r\n  - ignored (0)\r\n  - principal component signal extraction (4)\r\n  - scaled (4)\r\n\r\nPCA used 2 components as specified\r\n\r\nStep 2: Use the result from above to form a new inputs.

      "contents": "\r\n\r\nThis problem is the most interesting one out of the five that Dr.Hunt went over in class. The reason for that is this problem demonstrate how inaccurate Rsquare is when it come to predicting error by simply changing the range of X. In addition to that, this problem also shows an alternative to Rsquare, MSE, and shows how MSEA is better at predicting error compare to Rsquare.\r\nFirst we will comparing Rsquare and MSE\r\nA.Rsquare\r\n\r\n\r\nx <- seq(1,10,length.out = 100)\r\nset.seed(1)\r\ny <- 2 + 1.2*x + rnorm(100,0,sd = 0.9)\r\nmod1 <- lm(y ~ x)\r\nsummary(mod1)$r.squared\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.9383379\r\n\r\nB.MSE\r\n\r\n\r\nsum((fitted(mod1) - y)^2)/100\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.6468052\r\n\r\nWe will change the range of x and leave everything else as is\r\nA.Rsquare\r\n\r\n\r\nx <- seq(1,2,length.out = 100)      \r\nset.seed(1)\r\ny <- 2 + 1.2*x + rnorm(100,0,sd = 0.9)\r\nmod1 <- lm(y ~ x)\r\nsummary(mod1)$r.squared\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.1502448\r\n\r\nB.MSE\r\n\r\n\r\nsum((fitted(mod1) - y)^2)/100\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 0.6468052\r\n\r\n+The value of RSquare changed while the value of MSE stay the same. Rsquare give an illusion that that first model is better at predicting, when it is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
