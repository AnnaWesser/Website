Abandoned by her beloved;

Became a widow at twenty-three.

Cautiously, she took her step and

Diligently won over prince Harry, the heir to the throne.


England and Spain?

Forfeited Spain’s interest.

Grieving the death of her infant son, while

Henry VIII will not stop scorning

Isabella’s daughter, Catherine of Aragon.

Jeered by Cardinal Wosley;

“Keep him away,” she prayed. 

Loneliness profess itself.

Many nights she cried herself to sleep.

Narrating her own fairy tales with the king, but 

Of course, it will never come true, whatever she dreamt of.

Petrified by her husband’s infidelity,

Queen Catherine of Aragon

Regretted marrying the King.

“Shush,” she tried to stop her tears, for 

The Queen must appear strong and 

United with the King. 

Vulnerability cannot be shown, and she must be

Warry of the enemy in the court.

Xenophobia exists, although she is their Queen.

Young Catherine,

Zestful Princess of Wales has died.
